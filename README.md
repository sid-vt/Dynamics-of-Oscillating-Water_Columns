# Dynamics of oscillating water columns
Graduate level course project for **AOE 5034 - Mechanical and Structural Vibrations/Dynamics**
Under the guidance of **Dr. Gary Seidal - Virginia Tech**

# Brief Summary
This project analyize one of the techniques used to harvest ocean wave energy. It is a mechanical and structural dynamics analysis done by simulating a similar model in MATLAB. 

Performed a vibrational analysis on one of the techniques used for harvesting wave energy, including the eigenvalue analysis, mode shapes, free and forced excitation
the techniques taught in class, converted the problem into a Multi Degree of Freedom (6 DoFs), with harmonic excitation and proportional damping representing the harmonic motion of ocean waves, and springs representing stiffness in the strings
